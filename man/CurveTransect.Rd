\title{Curving Transect Distance Sampling}
\description{
`CurveTransect` facilitates distance sampling on a curving transect.
}
\details{
`observerXY`: creates points on a transect at specific meter intervals
`objectXY`: provides spatial coordinates for each detected object in a distance sampling survey
`cca`: calculates the an adjusted transect length for curved covered area calculations

Examples of how to use this package are available at
https://github.com/esbach/CurveTransect.

For help with distance sampling, there is a Google Group
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/distance-sampling.
